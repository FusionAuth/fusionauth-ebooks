# FusionAuth ebooks

This is the source for leanpub ebooks created for FusionAuth.

To build the ebooks, log into leanpub and load up these markdown files.

The current leanpub plan we are on only allows for 20 builds/month.

## Writing

Gather some previously written content. If not written by one author, add author attribution. See the kubernetes ebook for an example.

Check it in to this repository in a subdirectory. Create a subdirectory in that directory for images.

Remove useless links and CTAs.

Update the text like "article/blog/post/guide" to chapter

Get Sean or other artist to create cover images. You need both 1600x2560 and 1800x2700 in dimension.

Gather images and diagrams, put in images director, only png or jpg. Convert SVGs

Update all relative URLs (usually FusionAuth.io) to be absolute.

You may want to rewrite some articles, break some apart, add more diagrams, or separate them.

Write some new content.

At least intro and conclusion, maybe another chapter

Spellcheck and grammar check.

Set up and add CTA for t-shirt at the end.

## Publishing

Set price (usually about $25).

Allow 50% discount.

Add blurb about book (can draw from intro).

You can preview the book, and then publish it.

After you publish the PDF, get the epub and publish to the kindle store. https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/ (creds in 1password)

## Using only for PDF generation

If you are only using leanpub for PDF generation, then use the `forpdfgeneration` ebook and don't publish it. You can overwrite the chapters in that ebook which should never be 'live'.
