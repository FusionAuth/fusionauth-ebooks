# Conclusion

This book has covered a fair bit of ground on the topic authentication, authorization and Kubernetes. I hope you enjoyed learning more about how you can safely authenticate and authorize access to Kubernetes, both the internal clusters and the applications running on top of them. 

You also learned about JSON Web Tokens and how token based auth can be used within microservices.

At the end of the day, Kubernetes is an extremely powerful system with a lot of functionality included. Authentication and authorization are common to most applications, but require additional work to integrate with Kubernetes.
