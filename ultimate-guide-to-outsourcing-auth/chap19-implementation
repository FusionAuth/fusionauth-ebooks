# Implementation

Implementation of an auth system, whether migrating from an existing one or integrating a new one, is not a trivial task. If you have a large company, the actual rollout of a system may take years. I was at a conference and someone at such a company estimated that a complete consolidation of their identity infrastructure would take 3-5 years, even with unlimited budget.

Rather than poorly covering an implementation process deeply tied to your applications and userbase, this guide will focus on major features to consider when you are in the implementation phase. A detailed implementation plan is beyond the scope of this book.

In this section, you'll learn:

* The difference between multi-tenant and single tenant auth systems
* How to make sure your auth system can scale to meet your needs
* When it makes sense to self host critical infrastructure such as an auth system
* Migration options for moving auth data from an old system to a new one
* Best practices around registration forms

Let's jump in.
