# What is Identity Proofing?

C> *By Deborah Ruck and Dan Moore*

Identity theft is on the rise. In 2020, the [reported cases of identity theft](https://www.ftc.gov/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-2020) rose to 1,387,615, more than double the 650,572 cases reported in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of online transactions as businesses leveraged digital technologies to take advantage of new business opportunities. This resulted in the increase of sensitive information stored in the cloud and an elevated risk of identity theft. 

An effective identity proofing solution is more critical to your business than ever before. As companies and users engage in more online transactions and digital services, businesses must take greater measures to confirm a person is who they say they are. Identity proofing verifies and authenticates the identity of legitimate customers to prevent fraudulent users from accessing your data. It is your first line of defense against data breaches and theft.

From a gaming and esports perspective, whether or not you need to use identity proofing depends on a variety of factors:

* If your audience is children and you collect their PII, including a username, you may need to ensure parental consent, depending on your jurisdiction. Identity proofing may be involved in verifying such consent.
* If money is involved in your game, such as a fantasy football league with real money bets that is regulated by a state gambling agency.
* Whether you can rely on a third party identity provider, such as PSN, Steam or XBox, to take care of identity for you.

In many cases, identity proofing is not necessary, but when it is, you'll want to make sure you get it right.

In the rest of this chapter, we’ll explain how identity proofing works. 

## How Identity Proofing Works

Identity proofing provides several ways to verify a user’s identity, such as physical documentation, credit history, and biometric information. Let’s see how some of these methods work.  

### Identity Document Verification

Identity document verification can be a physical process or done digitally. Physical identity proofing occurs when a customer performs a face-to-face transaction at a company location and presents identity documents such as an ID card, passport, or driver’s license. A company employee compares the photograph on the documents with the person standing in front of them and validates the information supplied against an authoritative source, such as government or credit records. Once identity is established, documents are copied and physically stored. 

Businesses needing to establish real-world identity with online users can verify documentation using a scan of a valid passport or ID along with other verifiable personal information, like an address or phone number. To ensure that scanned documents aren’t stolen, businesses sometimes ask users to submit a selfie of themselves holding the documents. 

### Knowledge-Based Authentication

Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) verifies identity by asking a person a set of security questions with answers only that person should know, e.g., “What is the middle name of your oldest sibling?” or “What is your father’s middle name?” Questions cannot be answered with a yes or no, and sometimes there is a time limit on answering the question.

There are two types of KBA: static and dynamic. Static KBA asks the user questions from a set repository of questions in a company’s database. Both questions and answers are stored in the database and presented to the user when identity needs to be confirmed, such as for a  password reset. Static KBA is part of [multi-factor authentication or MFA](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/multifactor-authentication-MFA) and satisfies the “something you know” factor, but the answers to these questions can be easily discovered through social engineering. 

Dynamic KBA uses security questions automatically generated from a variety of different data sources, including the user’s credit history and public records. This is information only a legitimate user could give but is more difficult for a hacker to find out. 

### Out-of-Band Proofing

Out-of-band (OOB) authentication uses another channel besides an online process to authenticate an individual. OOB is commonly used for online banking to perform certain processes, such as logging in or changing the account to add a payee or change a password. When performing these types of actions, an authentication code is sent via SMS to the mobile device of the account holder.

OOB, also a form of MFA, increases security by requiring the person to have access to an external account or  another device in their possession. Using a separate channel makes it more difficult for an attacker to circumvent or intercept the proofing process  because the attacker would have to access and compromise two separate communication mechanisms.

### Biometric Verification

Biometric verification is used to identify individuals based on unique physical characteristics such as fingerprints, voiceprints, retina scans, signature comparisons, and DNA. Once only common in the most stringent security settings, these types of verification are becoming regular features in the latest smartphones and digital devices. 

Biometrics give greater assurance that a person is who they say they are. The verification is used in several industries, including healthcare to identify patients, law enforcement to track people in the judicial system, and government entities for voter registration. 

Biometrics are considered more secure than other forms of identification because they are unique to the individual and harder to forge or steal. They’re highly convenient after initial setup, requiring no passwords and no questions to be answered. 

## Conclusion

With the rise in online fraud and identity theft as well as expanding access to games across all audiences, understanding your risk posture and implementing an effective identity proofing solution can improve your organization’s security and legal standing. 

Identity proofing can be implemented in several ways to help you authenticate users, including document scanning, knowledge-based authentication, out-of-band authentication, and biometrics.
