# OAuth Grants

Now that we have covered the real world OAuth modes, let's dig into how these are actually implemented using the OAuth grants. The main OAuth grants are:

* Authorization Code grant
* Implicit grant
* Resource Owner's Password Credentials grant
* Client Credentials grant
* Device grant

We'll cover each grant type below and discuss how it is used, or not, for each of the OAuth modes above.
